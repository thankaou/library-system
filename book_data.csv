[1],49848,"[214, 220, 237, 2646, 2647, 2659, 2660, 2679]","SOLDIER FIVE is an elite soldier's explosive memoir of his time within the Special Air Service (SAS) and, in particular, his experiences during the 1991 Gulf War. As a member of the Special Forces patrol now famously known by its call sign Bravo Two Zero, he and seven others were inserted hundreds of kilometres behind enemy lines. Their mission to reconnoitre targets, undertake surveillance of Scud missil sites and sabotage Iraqi communications links was to end in desperate failure.From the outset, the patrol was dogged by problems that contributed both directly and indirectly to the demise of the mission. The patrol's compromise, and subsequent attempts to evade Iraqi troops, resulted in four members of Bravo Two Zero being captured and a further three killed. One escaped. But the story goes further that the Gulf War itself. Despite numerous books, films and articles on the same subject, the British Government has done its utmost to thwart the release of SOLDIER FIVE, at one stage claiming the book in its entirety was confidential. A campaign of harassment that took some four and a half years of litigation to resolve has now resulted in this controversial publication. SOLDIER FIVE is a gripping and suspenseful account of one man's experiences as a Special Forces soldier. Revealing his conflicts and loyalties, and the relationships he forged both on and off the battlefield, this book is the resolution of a soldier's determined fight to see his story told.",129,198,20,,,,1,9.78184E+12,,97c8e71f2ec114b34f243074d2091077,full/c/5/2/c529152ea1246c0cb17d6574d302eae6d2e7fb0a.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8401/9781840189070.jpg,Mainstream Publishing,,184018907X,9.78184E+12,en,10/14/2004 0:00,,4.03,292,Soldier Five : The Real Truth About The Bravo Two Zero Mission,/Soldier-Five-Mike-Coburn/9781840189070,224

One day, they had a meeting to end a dispute over drug money. Thinking he could scare his rival into submission, Moran pulled the trigger on Carl but decided not to finish the job off. It turned out to be the biggest mistake of his life.  Carl was hell bent on revenge. Within months, most of the Moran family and a host of underworld figures would die in an astonishing spate of revenge killings which shook the public and the police to the core.

Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis.

The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.  Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new ""behavioral futures markets,"" where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new ""means of behavioral modification.""  The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a ""Big Other"" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled ""hive"" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit -- at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future.

I used my Mom's guavas and it came out wonderfully smooth and creamy. The fresh guava is subtle and fragrant. I am actually not missing the heavy cream I would usually be using. The recipes run the gamut from classic favorites (Mint Chocolate Chip) to intriguing, mind-bending combinations (Carrot Apple Coconut Curry). It is more than an ice cream cookbook. It it a passionate treatise on taking ice cream making to the level of a grand adventure. I wonder how many ice cream machines were sacrificed testing these more than 100 recipes. I will definitely be trying more soon. I have my eye on the lilikoi frozen yogurt recipe next since I have so many lilikoi right now. -Dorothy Arriola Colby This recipe book contains 15 chapters and an Index for a total of 208 pages. In the last chapter it contains the topic of TROUBLE SHOOTING. I'd welcome seeing that in any cookbook I buy and use. For the most part, I stay out of the kitchen. So I should probably stay out of the kitchen for sure. But these recipes for ice cream are fascinating, and the many pictures entice the reader into trying something new and different. Who are the readers of this book? Readers who are tired of ordinary ice cream, who have dietary problems that require different ingredients, or who are searching for a new experience in ice cream eating. For those readers I recommend this book. In the first chapters, you'll learn the difference between ice cream, sherbet, sorbet, granita, and frozen yogurt. The author then introduces you to the various kinds of milk you may want to try-coconut, soy, grain milks and the ingredients you may want to mix with the milk. You'll need fats, starches, sweeteners, agave nectar, maple syrup and others. And to insure edible results you'll need the right equipment in your kitchen. This can be as simple or as elaborate as you care to make it. And of course, you'll find dozens of recipes to tempt you. My advice is to read the book through carefully before you begin trying a recipe. Each success will lead to another. This book is a winner.

The direct cause of the accident was cited as the depositing of a uranyl nitrate solution--containing about 16.6 kg of uranium, which exceeded the critical mass--into a precipitation tank. Three workers were exposed to extreme doses of radiation. Hiroshi Ouchi, one of these workers, was transferred to the University of Tokyo Hospital Emergency Room, three days after the accident. Dr. Maekawa and his staff initially thought that Ouchi looked relatively well for a person exposed to such radiation levels. He could talk, and only his right hand was a little swollen with redness. However, his condition gradually weakened as the radioactivity broke down the chromosomes in his cells. The doctors were at a loss as to what to do. There were very few precedents and proven medical treatments for the victims of radiation poisoning.

This book presents the potential uses and benefits of journals for personal and professional development - particularly for those in academic life; and demonstrates journals' potential to foster college students' learning, fluency and voice, and creative thinking. In professional life, a journal helps to organize, prioritize and address the many expectations of a faculty member's or administrator's roles. Journals are effective for developing time management skills, building problem-solving skills, fostering insight, and decreasing stress. Both writing and rereading journal entries allow the journal keeper to document thinking; to track changes and review observations; and to examine assumptions and so gain fresh perspectives and insights over past events.

Long neglected as little more than cerebral packing material, glia (meaning ""glue"") are now known to regulate the flow of information between neurons and to repair the brain and spinal cord after injury and stroke. But scientists are also discovering that diseased and damaged glia play a significant role in psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression, and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Diseased glia cause brain cancer and multiple sclerosis and are linked to infectious diseases such as HIV and prion disease (mad cow disease, for example) and to chronic pain.

A traditional breakfast dish, it gets its name from the cabbage which makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during cooking. On the more conventional front, just find a good-quality English greengrocer to create delicious and unusual vegetarian dishes, the best of which may be the leek and cheese sausage. With a harvest of fresh beans, peas, carrots and courgettes you have all the ingredients to make a rich terrine of vegetables that looks great too. It could be that an asparagus and pecorino risotto or a roast squash salad with feta cheese and toasted seeds is most tempting, but then again some of the most popular pub foods in England at the moment are a good vegetarian curry or mac 'n' cheese.

Simulations allow us to stage actual interactions among a population of agents and to observe the emergent wholes that result from those interactions. Simulations have become as important as mathematical models in theoretical science. As computer power and memory have become cheaper they have migrated to the desktop, where they now play the role that small-scale experiments used to play. A philosophical examination of the epistemology of simulations is needed to cement this new role, underlining the consequences that simulations may have for materialist philosophy itself. This remarkably clear philosophical discussion of a rapidly growing field, from a thinker at the forefront of research at the interface of science and the humanities, is a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of technology and the philosophy of science at all levels.",129,198,25.4,,,,2,9.78144E+12,black & white illustrations,b74ec806d2e1ef9c90be1066a5e6a5dd,full/0/a/2/0a2ba9a38e50dd9ac716cf7142ca814f34012784.jpg,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4411/9781441170286.jpg,,,1441170286,9.78144E+12,en,3/24/2011 0:00,,4.04,114,Philosophy and Simulation : The Emergence of Synthetic Reason,/Philosophy-Simulation-Manuel-Delanda/9781441170286,385.55
